//  you can search for files using the glob() function. The glob() function searches for files based on a specified pattern and returns an array of matching file paths. 


$files = glob('/path/to/files/*.txt');
foreach ($files as $file) {
    echo $file . '<br>';
}
// In this example, the glob() function searches for all files in the directory /path/to/files with the extension .txt and returns an array of matching file paths. The foreach loop then iterates over the array of file paths and prints each path to the screen.

// You can also use wildcards in the search pattern to match multiple files.


$files = glob('/path/to/files/*.{txt,pdf}', GLOB_BRACE);
foreach ($files as $file) {
    echo $file . '<br>';
}
// In this example, the glob() function searches for all files in the directory /path/to/files with the extensions .txt or .pdf and returns an array of matching file paths. The GLOB_BRACE flag tells glob() to use brace expansion to match multiple file extensions.

// Note that glob() is case-sensitive by default. To perform a case-insensitive search, you can use the GLOB_NOCASE flag.

// It's important to exercise caution when searching for files with PHP. Make sure that you are only searching in directories that you have permission to access, and make sure that your search pattern is specific enough to only match the files you are interested in.
