<?php
// you can delete files using the unlink() function. The unlink() function takes the path of the file to be deleted as its argument. 


if (unlink('/path/to/file.txt')) {
    echo 'File deleted successfully!';
} else {
    echo 'Failed to delete file.';
}
// In this example, the unlink() function deletes the file at /path/to/file.txt. If the deletion is successful, the script prints "File deleted successfully!"; otherwise, it prints "Failed to delete file."

// Note that unlink() only works with files. To delete a directory, you can use the rmdir() function, which only works if the directory is empty. If you want to delete a directory and all its contents, you can use the unlink() function in combination with scandir() to recursively delete all files and subdirectories in the directory.

// It's important to exercise caution when deleting files with PHP. Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to delete the file, and make sure that you are deleting the correct file. Once a file is deleted, it cannot be recovered.
